# rboss (Rust Bioinformatics Toolbox)

Welcome to rboss, the Rust Bioinformatics Toolbox, designed to provide robust, high-performance tools and libraries for bioinformatics analysis and computation.
Our goal is to leverage the safety and speed of Rust to handle the growing demands of bioinformatics data processing.

## Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV)

This project adheres to a Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) policy.
The MSRV for rboss is **1.70.0**.
We ensure that all code within the project is compatible with this version or newer to maintain stability and compatibility.

## Features

- **High Performance**: Take advantage of Rust's performance for heavy computational tasks.
- **Safety**: Rust's strong type system and ownership model ensure safety across bioinformatics operations.
- **Concurrency**: Utilize Rust's modern concurrency tools for parallel data processing.

## Getting Started

To get started with rboss, ensure you have the Rust toolchain installed on your system.
If not, you can install Rust using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

Once Rust is set up, you can clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rboss.git
cd rboss
```

To build the project, use:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

## Usage

The usage of individual tools and libraries within rboss will vary. Please refer to the documentation for specific modules.
